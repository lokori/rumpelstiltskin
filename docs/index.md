# Who we are

We are Rotco Oy, a team of six hackers from Finland. We are also known as white hat hackers of [Team ROT](https://www.rot.fi) for our non-profit activities. Hacking and learning new things about security is a passion for us, not just a job that pays the bills. We want to have fun, but professional.

# Rotco services 

We are mostly interested in technical penetration testing gigs and live hack events. We have wide experience in information security, backed up by deep knowledge about software development, linux and network administration and cloud services, but our main forte is in testing web based software systems.
